        "\n",
        "The typical lifecycle of a `metrax` metric involves a few steps, especially when processing data in batches or across distributed environments:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:** You usually start by creating a dictionary where keys represent the metric names and values are the initialized or uninitialized `metrax` metric states. When using the functional API (`metrax`), you'd use `Metric.empty()` to create an initial, empty state. With the object-oriented `metrax.nnx` API, you simply instantiate the metric class (`Metric()`).\n",
        "2. **Iteration/Batch Processing:** As you process data in batches or on different devices, you create a new metric state for the current batch/device using `Metric.from_model_output()` (functional API) or update the existing metric object with `.update()` (object-oriented API), passing the predictions, labels, and any relevant weights for that specific data slice.\n",
        "3. **Merging/Updating:** For the functional API, you merge the newly created metric state for the current batch/device with the accumulated state in your dictionary using the `.merge()` method. For the object-oriented API, the `.update()` method directly modifies the state within the metric object in your dictionary. This step accumulates the necessary statistics across all processed data.\n",
        "4. **Final Computation:** After processing all data, you call the `.compute()` method on the final, merged (functional API) or updated (object-oriented API) metric state in your dictionary. This performs the final calculations and returns the metric's value (e.g., a single floating-point number like AUCPR)."

        "`metrax` is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly in distributed environments. `Metrax` metrics are compatible with JAX's core parallelism primitives. The standard and most flexible way to scale computations is by using `jax.jit` in combination with the `jax.sharding` API to create explicitly sharded, Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) programs.\n",

        "### The `jit` and `Mesh` Approach (Explicit Sharding)\n",
        "\n",
        "For maximum flexibility and control over distributed computation, JAX provides an **explicit** sharding mechanism using the `jax.sharding` and `Mesh` APIs. This approach is more powerful than older APIs and is the standard for large-scale models that may require complex parallelism strategies (like model parallelism).\n",
        "\n",
        "The process involves a few clear steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define a `Mesh`**: You first create a logical grid of your physical devices and give names to the axes (e.g., `Mesh(jax.devices(), ('data',))`). This describes the topology you'll be working with.\n",
        "2.  **Create a `Sharding` Rule**: You specify exactly how each dimension of your array should be mapped to the mesh's axes. This is done using `NamedSharding` and `PartitionSpec`. For data parallelism, you would shard the batch axis of your data across the `'data'` axis of your mesh.\n",
        "3.  **Explicitly Place Data**: You use `jax.device_put` to apply this sharding rule to your data arrays. At this point, your JAX arrays are \"aware\" of how they are distributed across the physical hardware.\n",
        "4.  **`jit`-Compile the Function**: You write a function that looks like a normal, single-device calculation and decorate it with `@jax.jit`. When JAX's compiler sees that the inputs to this function are sharded arrays, it automatically generates a distributed version of the code, implicitly handling all cross-device communication.\n",
